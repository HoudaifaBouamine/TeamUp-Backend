# TeamUp
### Overview
  TeamUp addresses the difficulty of finding serious teams and mentors to guide beginners, as well as the challenge of contributing to open-source projects or securing internships for real project experience. The platform serves as a space where mentors can publish software projects for others to join, aiding software learners in finding teams to build projects under the guidance of a mentor. This facilitates learning teamwork, understanding how real-world projects are built, and gaining technical experience. Collaboration is central to our ethos, and mentors can be individuals with only slightly more experience than mentees, offering free or low-cost mentorship.
